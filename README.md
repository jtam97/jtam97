# 👋 Hello, I'm Justin!

I’m a **Ph.D. student in Computer Science** at **Lehigh University**, working on all kinds of cool problems in **Structural Bioinformatics**! I'm trying to unlock protein structures for all those curious.

## 💻 What I Work On
For my research, I wear many many hats:
- Computational biology specialist
- Math major and mathematical proofs enjoyer 🧩
- Data scientist by spirit. really. See my data analysis on PokemonGo, Path Of Exile, car crashes in California, MMA bets, anything I think would be fun to analyze.
- Machine learning expert (Originally a side project that became the focal point of my PhD dissertation and my career path) 
- Full-stack web developer (In the pursuit of user-friendly research)
- Even some wet lab work in protein synthesis 🧬
  
PhD life is a lot like proteins — dynamic, complex, and endlessly fascinating!

## 🔮 Fun Facts
- I’ve worked at **Moderna** on their Bioinformatics R&D team, contributing directly to their computational pipeline and to cutting-edge vaccine research. 💉
- I balance my PhD with building quirky **web apps** for fun projects. The funnier, the better. 🕹️
